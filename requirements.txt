#Install node.js on your device, add to environment variables (PATH)

#Install Git version 2.48.1, add to PATH as well

#Run this command to get dependencies (Express.js, dotenv, OpenAI API)
npm install express dotenv openai

# Note: Create the '.env' file under the FastFood_AI directory and add the below:
OPENAI_API_KEY = insert_your_api_key
PORT = 5000

# If you've made edits and want to push, perform the below:

git add .
git commit -m "insert_commit_message_here"
git push origin master

# In remotely pulling/pushing to our git, we'll be using SSH tokens. If you're not familiar with this, the procedure is like so:

# Enter the following command to generate an SSH key: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
# Optionally you may enter a passphrase, make sure to remember it though
# Run this command to generate your key and copy the entire resulting line: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Add this key to your GitHub via Settings --> SSH keys, name it whatever you want and paste your key
# Run this command to verify your key is active: ssh -T git@github.com
# It should say you successfully authenticated
# Lastly, clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:NickGTollinger/CS4485-Team-6.git
# If you run into any issues, try to Google around to solve it. If all else fails, let me know and we'll figure it out.g
